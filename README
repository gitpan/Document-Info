Welcome to a new Module!

Document::Info v0.01 - Determine the file type of office documents.

(Currently mainly, cough, supported: MS Excel, MS Powerpoint and MS Word.)


DESCRIPTION

The module tries to figure out the document type of Office files. It utilizes
OLE::Storage to determine the file type of Windows documents. The module is
in a very early state.

Along with it comes the little demo application "lfile". If Document::Info
cannot yield the documents type it simply utilizes the well known file(1).

I'd enjoy your feedback about the package hierarchy "Document::Info" and 
like especially to know if you regard the module being useful at all.


EXAMPLE

    use Document::Info;

    if ( $Info=Document::Info->new($fileName) ) {;
        # $Info constructed, that means something has been determined.

        # Fetch the currently supported properties.
        $type = $Info -> getType ( );
        $rev  = $Info -> getRevision ( );
        $os   = $Info -> getOS ( );

        if ( $type eq $Info->cMSExcel() ) {
           # Do something. Note: when checking a type or an operating System
           # always use the string constants like cMSExcel().
        }
        if ( !$revision ) {
            # revision not determined.
        }
    } else {
        # Document type could not be determined.
    }
